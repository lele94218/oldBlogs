![Process for Java](/learning.png)

### My Log

- UPD： `2/22/2016`

I stop learning _Spring_ since I need to study sort of _Java Web_. In several days, I searched a very interesting video tutorials [Atguigu Java Tutorials Serials](http://www.atguigu.com/download.shtml#javascript). After learning the _Servlet_ and _JSP_, I know my shortcomings with _Java Web_.

**KEEP LEARNING!!!**

- UPD： `1/19/2016`

I start learning Java in Spring with [Follow me Learning Spring 3 (Chinese) ](http://jinnianshilongnian.iteye.com/category/206533) which is friendly for freshman. I insist that Spring is an useful MVC framework, which could implement with J2EE, Android, .NET, etc.

Here to recommend some references:

- **Spring in Action, 3th Edition**
