Now, I start learning Java in Spring with [跟我学spring3系列](http://jinnianshilongnian.iteye.com/category/206533). I insist that Spring is an useful MVC framework, which could implement with J2EE, Android, .NET, etc.

Here to recommend some references:

- **Spring in Action, 4th Edition**

### To-Do List
------
- **Resource Management**


### Completed List
------
**1/19/2016**

- **IoC** (Inversion of Control)


- **DI** (Dependency Injection)
