## My Log

- UPD: `2/12/2016`

Almost finish _Java Web_ Tutorials!!!!

- UPD: `2/2/2016`

I stop learning _Spring_ since I need to study sort of _Java Web_. In several days, I searched a very interesting video tutorials [Atguigu Java Tutorials Serials](http://www.atguigu.com/download.shtml#javascript). After learning the _Servlet_ and _JSP_, I know my shortcomings with _Java Web_.

**KEEP LEARNING!!!**

- UPD: `1/19/2016`

I start learning Java in Spring with [Follow me Learning Spring 3 (Chinese) ](http://jinnianshilongnian.iteye.com/category/206533) which is friendly for freshman. I insist that Spring is an useful MVC framework, which could implement with J2EE, Android, .NET, etc.

Here to recommend some references:

- **Spring in Action, 4th Edition**

- **Spring in Action, 3th Edition**
