Now, I start learning Java in Spring with [跟我学spring3系列](http://jinnianshilongnian.iteye.com/category/206533). I insist that Spring is a useful MVC framework, which could implement with J2EE, Android, .NET, etc.

Here to recommend some references:

<ul>
	<li>Spring in Action, 4th Edition</li>
</ul>

## Completed List 

**Till 01/29/2016**

<ul>
	<li>Ioc (Inversion of Control)</li>
	<li>DI (Dependency Injection)</li>
</ul>

## To-Do List

<ul>
	<li>Resource Management</li>
</ul>
